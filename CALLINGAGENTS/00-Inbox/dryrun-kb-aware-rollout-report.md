## Recommended next steps

1. Review per-client JSON at `dryrun-{slug}-kb-aware.json` — diff `currentPrompt` vs `previewPrompt`.
2. Pick low-risk clients to live-recompose first. Skip any showing `safety guards lost` or `STILL PRESENT` blanket rules.
3. For each chosen client: copy/adapt `scripts/recompose-brian.ts` with the slug, run `--live`.
4. Real test call → check `tool_invocations` table for `queryKnowledge` fires.
5. **Snowflake clients with hand_tuned=true:** force-recompose wipes any hand-tuning. Confirm with owner before deploying.
