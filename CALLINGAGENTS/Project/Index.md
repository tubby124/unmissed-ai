# unmissed.ai — Project Knowledge Graph

> Voice agent SaaS. Railway + Ultravox + Twilio + Supabase + Next.js 15.

## Latest Session (2026-04-29 — Learning Bank platform + Zara rewrite)
- **D440 Learning Bank scaffolded** — 3 migrations (`prompt_patterns`, `prompt_lessons`, `pattern_application_log`, `call_transcripts`, `v_active_patterns_by_niche` view + 24-row seed), `/completed` webhook auto-generates lessons from `call_insights` thresholds, admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/learning-bank`, gated pattern injection in `slot-regenerator.ts` behind `LEARNING_BANK_INJECT=true` (default OFF), backfill script `scripts/backfill-transcripts.ts`, `/learn` skill (audit | promote-pattern | weekly-digest | seed) registered.
- **D441 Zara rewrite** — `clients/unmissed-demo/SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt` rewritten 11,991 → 10,844 chars; 14 NEVER rules → 5; cut EMERGENCY/RETURNING/<25w-rule/casual-forcing-function; ported 10 universal Learning Bank patterns from windshield-hub/urban-vibe/hasan-sharif. Identity drift fixed: `clients.agent_name` Aria → Zara (applied live).
- **Pending manual ops:** `supabase db push` (3 migrations not yet applied to remote `qwhvblomlgeapzhnuwlb`), `/prompt-deploy unmissed-demo` (Zara prompt not yet deployed), `npx tsx scripts/backfill-transcripts.ts --limit 200` (transcript backfill not yet run).

## Previous Session (2026-04-28 PM — Telegram Tier 1 + 2 LIVE, Tier 3 READY)
- **Tier 1** PR #41 squash-merged sha `03ad11c0`. Migration `telegram_updates_seen` applied. `/help` `/calls` `/today` `/missed` `/lastcall` `/minutes` live across registered clients.
- **Tier 2** PR #47 squash-merged sha `74f1ac4`. Migration `telegram_assistant_log` applied. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set in Railway. Bot menu + persistent inline keyboard + `callback_query` re-dispatch + Haiku 4.5 NL Q&A + citation guard + keyword shortcuts + PII-free cost telemetry. 32+ tests green.
- **Tier 2 cleanup** — PR #48 (`const outcome` lint, sha `a0e409f`).
- **Tier 3 READY** — cold-start at [[00-Inbox/NEXT-CHAT-Telegram-Tier3]]. Scope: confirmable mutations (`cb:<id>`/`mk:<id>`/`cf:<uuid>`), DB-backed `telegram_pending_actions`, operator `/clients` `/health` `/spend` gated by slug='hasan-sharif', per-client spend cap, 1% reply-audit, group-chat `/start` guard. 9 commits planned. Followups + gaps: [[00-Inbox/Telegram-Tier3-Followups-2026-04-28]].
- **Bot renamed** 2026-04-28 evening: `@hassitant_1bot` → **`@AIReceptionist_bot`** via @BotFather. Token unchanged → zero disruption to registered clients. Railway env vars `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` set to `AIReceptionist_bot`; all 7 code fallbacks updated. Rename ops plan: [[00-Inbox/Telegram-Bot-Rename-Plan-2026-04-28]].

## Previous Session (2026-04-28 — Realtor onboarding polish + universal recording consent)
- 6 waves shipped in one session, build green (`npm run build` 6.2s)
- **Wave 1** — UI/copy fixes: "WebRTC" → "Web Browser Call" everywhere, inline "Save snippet" on call detail (call_snippet source), trial-clarity caption + forwarding note above chip grid, AgentIdentityCardCompact gets `isTrial` + `hasForwarding` props
- **Wave 1.5** — Universal recording consent (legal protection): migration `20260428010953_add_recording_consent.sql` + onboarding checkbox + grandfathered backfill modal + voicemail pipeline mirror + outbound `/api/dashboard/leads/dial-out` 403 gate. Auto-enables `RECORDING_DISCLOSURE` for new clients only — 4 grandfathered clients keep prompts untouched. See [[Features/Recording-Consent]] + [[Tracker/S16a]]
- **Wave 2** — GBP modal shows extracted fields (name, hours, website, rating), Knowledge page reads `?source=` param + Website chip deep-links to filtered Browse view
- **Wave 3** — AI Receptionist 400 → 200 minutes across pricing.ts + plan-entitlements.ts + UpgradeModal + BillingTab. Existing subs grandfathered. ADR: [[Decisions/2026-04-28-ai-receptionist-200-minutes]]
- **Wave 5 (DOC ONLY)** — Outbound Realtor ISA + Market RAG fully spec'd at [[Features/Outbound-Realtor-ISA-Market-RAG]] for future multi-month build
- **Deferred to next session:** Wave 4 (realtor prompt rebuild + Buy/Sell/Eval/Rent intent branching), Wave 5 implementation
- Manual ops pending (next session A1-A6): apply migration to prod Supabase `qwhvblomlgeapzhnuwlb`, update Stripe `prod_UCl8nni05Nk9lB` description, sweep marketing pages for "400 min" copy, smoke-test backfill modal on grandfathered clients

- **Deleted:** `AgentKnowledgeTile`, `KnowledgeInlineTile`, `KnowledgeSourcesTile`, `TrialActiveSection` (orphans after rewire) + dead Recent-Calls inline block in `UnifiedHomeSection`
