# unmissed.ai — Project Knowledge Graph

> Voice agent SaaS. Railway + Ultravox + Twilio + Supabase + Next.js 15.

## Latest Session (2026-05-03 — Dashboard Trust-Core Sprint)
- **Dashboard trust-core shipped locally** — Overview capability truth now prefers runtime/deployed tool state for Knowledge, Booking, SMS, and Transfer, with DB/home fallback when runtime state is unavailable or unknown. `QuickConfigStrip` and `CapabilitiesCard` now show `Not live` / `Saved, but not live yet` when stored config says enabled but runtime tools are missing.
- **New helper + tests** — `src/lib/runtime-tool-truth.ts`, `runtime-tool-truth.test.ts`, and `tests/dashboard-trust-core.spec.ts`. D450 received an explicit `twilio_number` sync-trigger regression assertion.
- **Real runtime warning fixed** — authenticated Playwright caught invalid nested buttons in `VoicePicker` on `/dashboard/agent`; fixed by making the outer voice dropdown trigger an accessible `role="button"` container.
- **E2E account ready** — `e2etest@unmissed.ai` password rotated to the requested temporary test value. Do not store the plaintext in vault notes; run e2e with `TEST_PASSWORD=...`.
- **Verification** — `npm run build` passed; `npm run test:all` passed (1826 pass, 2 skipped); local authenticated dashboard group passed serially against `http://localhost:3002` (16 passed, 5 skipped). Skips are Phase 4 settings e2e cases gated by admin/service env.
- **Tracker updates** — [[Tracker/D447]] marked `phase-2-capabilities-done`; [[Tracker/D450]] resolved; session note at [[Dashboard/2026-05-03-dashboard-trust-core-sprint]].
- **D446 resolved after sprint note** — shared tool extractor now normalizes all three Ultravox wire shapes (`toolName`, `nameOverride`, `temporaryTool.modelToolName`) and preserves/logs unknown shapes. D442 fixture rerun shows no `hangUp` divergence across the 5 audited clients; remaining tool cleanup is separate (`hasan-sharif` stage/tool mismatch review, `urban-vibe` DB-only `pageOwner` sweep decision).
- **Still next** — [[Tracker/D449]] remaining SyncStatusChip rollout, trial auto-disable policy, domain purchase/verified sending domain, carrier-aware Go Live wizard, and snowflake migrations only on explicit owner need.

## Previous Session (2026-04-30 PM — D448 mutation contract resolved + audit-script bug surfaced)
- **D448 RESOLVED** — mutation contract `clients.tools` runtime-authority claim is CORRECT. Two parallel sub-agent dispatches (code-reading + empirical Supabase diff) confirmed: H1 (synthesized at call site) FALSE, H2 (`removeAll: true` doesn't strip) FALSE, H3 (stale clients.tools) refuted on stated symptom. The "universal hangUp gap on all 5 clients" was a D442 audit script extractor bug — script scanned only `modelToolName` and missed built-in tools using `toolName` key. `hangUp` IS in `clients.tools` for `windshield-hub` (zero drift) and `hasan-sharif` (only `pageOwner` missing). Other 3 clients pending re-verification with corrected scan.
- **Recurring bug pattern surfaced** — [[Tracker/D444]] closed this exact bug class as "false-alarm" but the fix was never applied; D442 re-bit. Concept: [[concepts/unmissed/unmissed-tool-extractor-bug]]. Durable rule: never close as "false alarm" if the underlying script still has the bug — leave open with `status: known-fix-deferred`.
- **`syncClientTools()` is pure DB write** — no `updateAgent()` call, no Ultravox API call, no prompt rebuild ([src/lib/sync-client-tools.ts:1-53](../../src/lib/sync-client-tools.ts) header explicit). Standing no-redeploy rule does NOT apply to standalone calls. The D448 spec was wrong about this — claimed it rebuilds the prompt.
- **No code changed this session.** Vault-only updates.
  - [[Tracker/D448]] resolved with full findings
  - [[Tracker/D449]] new spec — per-field "Saved, but not live yet" warning chip
  - [[Tracker/D450]] new spec — `twilio_number` → `needsAgentSync` one-liner
  - [[00-Inbox/NEXT-CHAT-D442-Followup]] rev 3 with corrected priorities
  - Master vault: [[2026-04-30-d448-mutation-contract-resolved]] session log + [[concepts/unmissed/unmissed-tool-extractor-bug]] durable concept + index 107→108 + memory.md appended
- **D447 (runtime-truth Overview chip) recommendation: defer indefinitely.** With the universal symptom refuted, D443 (shipped) + D449 + D450 close the addressable trust gap. D447's exclusive value (`partial_failure` + novel-drift detection) is latent.
- **Architectural risk surfaced (D452 candidate):** any new tool added to `buildAgentTools()` produces latent universal drift across all clients without a recent `needsAgentSync` PATCH. Mitigation needed — either PR discipline (one-shot migration script per tool addition) or weekly cron sweep on `last_synced_at < 30 days`.
- **Next:**
  - File D451 (audit script extractor fix — verify [[Tracker/D446]] doesn't already cover it)
  - Re-verify `exp-realty` + `urban-vibe` + `calgary-property-leasing` with corrected scan
  - Targeted `syncClientTools()` add for `hasan-sharif` (pure DB, safe) — and others if step 2 finds drift
  - Velly test + send still pending from earlier session

## Previous Session (2026-04-29 PM — Voicemail removal SOP + Admin Redesign Wave B SHIPPED)
- **PR [#56](https://github.com/tubby124/unmissed-ai/pull/56)** squash-merged → `main` (commit `c0a781b`). Railway deployment `13333cb7` SUCCESS.
  - Carrier voicemail must be FULLY REMOVED before conditional CF works. Validated 2026-04-29 on Hasan's Rogers Business 403-808-9705 line. Voicemail and `*61/*67/*62` share the same GSM supplementary service slot — voicemail wins, forward never fires.
  - Go Live page: collapsible amber "Test went to voicemail instead?" disclosure with Rogers/Bell/Telus/Fido/SaskTel numbers + script
  - Brian welcome email (HTML+TXT): voicemail-removal callout under Step 1
  - Velly welcome email (HTML+TXT): created from Brian's pattern (DID `**004*13069887699#`, $29/mo, Kausar). `VELLY_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` to swap before send.
  - Concierge Onboarding SOP Step 6 split into 6a (mandatory voicemail removal) → 6b (forwarding codes) → 6c (verify)
  - ADR: [[Decisions/2026-04-29-voicemail-removal-required-for-cf]]
- **PR [#57](https://github.com/tubby124/unmissed-ai/pull/57)** squash-merged → `main` (commit `42265f7`). Initial deploy `d99c85e4` FAILED on TS error (squash dropped `isAdmin` from `GoLiveView` destructure even though Props declared it and JSX used it).
  - Admin Redesign Phase 0.5 → 3 Wave B: feature flag, audit log table, `useClientScope()` hook, `<ClientSwitcher>` pill, Command Center moved to `/dashboard/admin`, `admin-scope-helpers.ts` + 25 routes guarded for cross-client writes
  - Behind `ADMIN_REDESIGN_ENABLED=false` → zero user impact at merge time
- **PR [#58](https://github.com/tubby124/unmissed-ai/pull/58)** hotfix squash-merged → `main` (commit `b421c4d`). Railway deployment `1865f782` SUCCESS.
  - One-line forward-fix: add `isAdmin` to `GoLiveView({ client, isAdmin }: Props)` destructure
  - All three commits ([`c0a781b`, `42265f7`, `b421c4d`]) now LIVE in production
- **Next:**
  - Velly: swap `VELLY_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER` and send Kausar's welcome email (still unblocked from earlier session)
  - D437 concierge provisioning gate (P0 study) — 6-gate state derivation per client, free-50-min vs card-required pricing decision
  - When ready: flip `ADMIN_REDESIGN_ENABLED=true` in Railway env to activate Wave B for users

## Previous Session (2026-04-29 AM — Learning Bank platform + Zara rewrite SHIPPED)
- **PR [#55](https://github.com/tubby124/unmissed-ai/pull/55)** squash-merged to `main` (commit `eb7c42e`). Railway auto-deployed.
- **D440 Learning Bank LIVE** — 4 migrations applied to `qwhvblomlgeapzhnuwlb` via `supabase db push` (also caught up the queued `admin_audit_log` migration). New tables: `prompt_patterns` (24 rows seeded), `prompt_lessons` (will populate as new calls land), `pattern_application_log`, `call_transcripts` (93 rows backfilled). View `v_active_patterns_by_niche` live. `/completed` webhook auto-generates lessons from `call_insights` thresholds. Admin UI at `/dashboard/admin/learning-bank`. Gated pattern injection in `slot-regenerator.ts` behind `LEARNING_BANK_INJECT=true` (default OFF — flip per-niche after manual validation). Backfill `scripts/backfill-transcripts.ts` working (slug join fixed, type fix on `CallLogRow`). `/learn` skill registered.
- **D441 Zara rewrite LIVE** — v13 deployed to Supabase + Ultravox (revision `d5325717-a53a-4bd7-9aa7-8a636f36df24`). 11,991 → 10,708 chars; 14 NEVER rules → 5; cut EMERGENCY/RETURNING/<25w-rule/casual-forcing-function; ported capability-triage (windshield-hub) + energy-match + confirm-back (urban-vibe) + skip-step (hasan-sharif). Identity drift fixed: `clients.agent_name` Aria → Zara.
- **Pre-existing migration drift fixed** — `20260428210000_create_telegram_pending_actions.sql` and `20260428300000_create_admin_audit_log.sql` both now in sync remote↔local.
- **Next:** test call to Zara to verify warmer voice; review first auto-generated `prompt_lessons` after a few new production calls land; flip `LEARNING_BANK_INJECT=true` for one niche when ready to validate pattern injection.

## Previous Session (2026-04-28 PM — Telegram Tier 1 + 2 LIVE, Tier 3 READY)
- **Tier 1** PR #41 squash-merged sha `03ad11c0`. Migration `telegram_updates_seen` applied. `/help` `/calls` `/today` `/missed` `/lastcall` `/minutes` live across registered clients.
- **Tier 2** PR #47 squash-merged sha `74f1ac4`. Migration `telegram_assistant_log` applied. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set in Railway. Bot menu + persistent inline keyboard + `callback_query` re-dispatch + Haiku 4.5 NL Q&A + citation guard + keyword shortcuts + PII-free cost telemetry. 32+ tests green.
- **Tier 2 cleanup** — PR #48 (`const outcome` lint, sha `a0e409f`).
- **Tier 3 READY** — cold-start at [[00-Inbox/NEXT-CHAT-Telegram-Tier3]]. Scope: confirmable mutations (`cb:<id>`/`mk:<id>`/`cf:<uuid>`), DB-backed `telegram_pending_actions`, operator `/clients` `/health` `/spend` gated by slug='hasan-sharif', per-client spend cap, 1% reply-audit, group-chat `/start` guard. 9 commits planned. Followups + gaps: [[00-Inbox/Telegram-Tier3-Followups-2026-04-28]].
- **Bot renamed** 2026-04-28 evening: `@hassitant_1bot` → **`@AIReceptionist_bot`** via @BotFather. Token unchanged → zero disruption to registered clients. Railway env vars `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` set to `AIReceptionist_bot`; all 7 code fallbacks updated. Rename ops plan: [[00-Inbox/Telegram-Bot-Rename-Plan-2026-04-28]].
- Decisions: [[Decisions/2026-04-28-Telegram-Tier1-Slash-Router]] · [[Decisions/2026-04-28-Telegram-Tier2-NL-Assistant]] · [[Decisions/2026-04-28-Telegram-Tier3-Mutation-Surface]]

## Previous Session (2026-04-28 — Realtor onboarding polish + universal recording consent)
- 6 waves shipped in one session, build green (`npm run build` 6.2s)
- **Wave 1** — UI/copy fixes: "WebRTC" → "Web Browser Call" everywhere, inline "Save snippet" on call detail (call_snippet source), trial-clarity caption + forwarding note above chip grid, AgentIdentityCardCompact gets `isTrial` + `hasForwarding` props
- **Wave 1.5** — Universal recording consent (legal protection): migration `20260428010953_add_recording_consent.sql` + onboarding checkbox + grandfathered backfill modal + voicemail pipeline mirror + outbound `/api/dashboard/leads/dial-out` 403 gate. Auto-enables `RECORDING_DISCLOSURE` for new clients only — 4 grandfathered clients keep prompts untouched. See [[Features/Recording-Consent]] + [[Tracker/S16a]]
- **Wave 2** — GBP modal shows extracted fields (name, hours, website, rating), Knowledge page reads `?source=` param + Website chip deep-links to filtered Browse view
- **Wave 3** — AI Receptionist 400 → 200 minutes across pricing.ts + plan-entitlements.ts + UpgradeModal + BillingTab. Existing subs grandfathered. ADR: [[Decisions/2026-04-28-ai-receptionist-200-minutes]]
- **Wave 5 (DOC ONLY)** — Outbound Realtor ISA + Market RAG fully spec'd at [[Features/Outbound-Realtor-ISA-Market-RAG]] for future multi-month build
